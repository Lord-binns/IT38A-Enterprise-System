 "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

 b. Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation

     b.1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
        - Starbucks ( Oracle Enterprise Resource planning)

        Starbucks is  a global coffeehouse chain that initiated the  Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to automate its operations and improve supply chain management and the decision-making process. Becuase of the fast expansion of Starbucks worldwide. This created challenges in inventory control with financial functions and also human resource management processeses. To resolve these issues, Starbucks needed an integrated system to provide real-time data that can optimize operational efficiency and also support the growth strategy of the company.


     b.2. implementation process

        Starbucks took a step-by-step approach in implementing Oracle ERP. It started with an exhaustive needs assessment and then system customization to meet Starbucks' unique operational requirements. The implementation included significant staff training, pilot testing in some regions, and a phased rollout to all locations. Feedback loops ensured continuous improvement and reduced the disruptions of the transition process.


     b.3. Key success factors

    1.  Strong Leadership and Clear Vision: Executive sponsorship and a clear strategic vision guided the project.

    2. Employee Training and Change Management: Comprehensive training programs ensured staff readiness and acceptance.

    3. Customization and Flexibility: Tailoring the Oracle ERP system to meet specific business needs.

    4. Effective Project Management: Rigorous planning, timelines, and resource allocation.

    5. Continuous Monitoring and Feedback: Regular assessment and adaptation to challenges during implementation.

     b.4. outcomes & impact

    The Oracle ERP implementation at Starbucks led to tremendous improvements in the efficiency of its operations, accuracy of data, and speed of decision-making. It streamlined the supply chain process, enhanced financial reporting, and improved inventory management. The system also facilitated better human resource management and contributed to Starbucks' ability to scale its operations globally with agility. 



c. case study 2: Failed Enterprise System Implementation

     c.1. company overview (Reason for implementing the enterprise system)

     -Uniwide Sales ()

    Uniwide Sales, Inc., a former top retail chain in the Philippines, attempted to improve its operations through an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. The objective was to enhance the efficiency of supply chains, inventory management, and overall operations to effectively compete with the retail empires of SM and Robinsons.

     c.2. implementation process & challenges

    The implementation of Uniwide's ERP system was not well planned and hasty. System integration was one major problem and lack of strategy was prevalent, so the new system would not usually fit current processes, which disrupted it frequently. Moreover, there was minimal staff training, and resistance to change was widespread in employees.

     c.3. Key failure factors

      1.  Lack of Clear Strategy: No well-defined roadmap for implementation.

    2. Inadequate Staff Training: Employees were not properly trained to use the new system.

    3. Resistance to Change: Strong opposition from employees who were used to old processes.

    4. Poor System Integration: The ERP system did not align with existing workflows.

    5. Financial Constraints: The company faced financial difficulties that hindered the completion and maintenance of the system.
