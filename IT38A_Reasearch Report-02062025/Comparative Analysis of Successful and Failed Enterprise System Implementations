 "Comparative Analysis of Successful and Failed Enterprise System Implementations"

 b. Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation

     b.1. company overview (Why the enterprise system was implemented)
        - Starbucks ( Oracle Enterprise Resource planning)

        Starbucks is  a global coffeehouse chain that initiated the  Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) to automate its operations and improve supply chain management and the decision-making process.
